                    <h4>Appointments & Scheduling</h4>
                    <p>Sessions are typically 50 minutes in length. Please arrive on time for your appointment. For in-person sessions, please check in at the front desk. For telehealth sessions, please log in a few minutes early to ensure your technology is working properly.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Cancellation Policy</h4>
                    <p>We require at least 24 hours notice for cancellations or rescheduling. This allows us to offer your time slot to another client in need. Late cancellations (less than 24 hours notice) or no-shows may be subject to a fee equal to the full session rate, which cannot be billed to insurance.</p>
                    
                    <p>We understand that emergencies and unexpected situations occur. If you need to cancel with less than 24 hours notice due to a genuine emergency, please contact us as soon as possible and we will work with you on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Communication</h4>
                    <p>For non-urgent matters, please contact us by phone or email. We will respond within 24-48 business hours. Brief check-ins or scheduling questions are welcome between sessions.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>In case of a mental health emergency</strong>, please call 911, go to your nearest emergency room, or call/text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Our practice is not equipped to handle emergency situations outside of scheduled session times.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Professional Boundaries</h4>
                    <p>To maintain the therapeutic relationship and your privacy, we do not accept social media connections (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.) with current or former clients. All communication should occur through professional channels (phone, email, or patient portal).</p>
                    
                    <p>If we encounter each other in public, we will not acknowledge the therapeutic relationship unless you initiate contact first. This protects your privacy and confidentiality.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Record Keeping</h4>
                    <p>We maintain clinical records in accordance with Connecticut state law and professional ethical guidelines. Your records are kept confidential and stored securely. You have the right to request copies of your records at any time.</p>

                    <h4>Insurance</h4>
                    <p>We are in-network with most major insurance providers. Please contact our office to verify your specific coverage. We will bill your insurance directly as a courtesy to you.</p>
                    
                    <p>Please be aware that your insurance company may require a mental health diagnosis for coverage, and they may request information about your treatment. We are required to provide this information to your insurance company in order to receive payment.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Insurance Verification</h4>
                    <p>Before your first appointment, we recommend contacting your insurance company to verify your mental health benefits. Questions to ask include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do I have mental health benefits?</li>
                        <li>What is my deductible and has it been met?</li>
                        <li>What is my co-pay or coinsurance for outpatient mental health services?</li>

                    <h4>Self-Pay Rates</h4>
                    <p>For those without insurance or who prefer to self-pay, we offer competitive rates. Please contact our office for current fee information. Payment is due at the time of service unless other arrangements have been made in advance.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Payment Methods</h4>
                    <p>We accept cash, check, and major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover). Payment is due at the time of service unless other arrangements have been made in advance.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Superbills</h4>
                    <p>For out-of-network insurance plans, we can provide detailed superbills that you can submit to your insurance company for potential reimbursement. Superbills include all necessary information for insurance claims, including diagnosis codes and service dates.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Sliding Scale</h4>
                    <p>We have limited sliding scale spots available for those experiencing financial hardship. Please inquire about availability during your initial consultation. Sliding scale rates are determined based on income and are offered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Fees for Additional Services</h4>
                    <p>Additional fees may apply for services such as:</p>

                    <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Therapeutic Relationship</h4>
                    <p>By engaging in therapy services with Aligned Mind Psychiatry and Wellness, you agree to participate actively in your treatment and to communicate openly about your experiences, concerns, and progress. Therapy is most effective when both parties work collaboratively.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Scope of Services</h4>
                    <p>Our services are designed to support mental health and wellness through psychotherapy and counseling. Therapy is not a substitute for medical treatment, and we may recommend additional services or referrals when appropriate, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Psychiatric evaluation for medication management</li>
                        <li>Medical evaluation for physical health concerns</li>

                        <li>Higher levels of care if needed (intensive outpatient, partial hospitalization, or inpatient treatment)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Limitations and Risks</h4>
                    <p>While we strive to provide the highest quality care, we cannot guarantee specific outcomes from therapy. Progress depends on many factors, including your active participation, life circumstances, and other factors outside of therapy.</p>
                    
                    <p>Therapy can sometimes bring up uncomfortable emotions or memories. This is a normal part of the therapeutic process, but it's important to communicate with your therapist about your experience.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Client Responsibilities</h4>
                    <p>As a client, you are responsible for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attending scheduled appointments or providing adequate notice for cancellations</li>
                        <li>Paying for services as agreed</li>
                        <li>Communicating openly and honestly during sessions</li>

                        <li>Following through with any agreed-upon homework or outside activities</li>
                        <li>Contacting emergency services if you are in crisis outside of session times</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Termination</h4>
                    <p>Either party may terminate the therapeutic relationship at any time. We encourage you to discuss any concerns about therapy before making a decision to terminate.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you choose to end therapy, we recommend scheduling a final session to review progress, discuss next steps, and ensure continuity of care. We will provide appropriate referrals if requested.</p>
                    
                    <p>We may terminate the therapeutic relationship if:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your needs are outside our scope of practice or expertise</li>
                        <li>There is a conflict of interest</li>
                        <li>Payment arrangements are not honored</li>
                        <li>You miss multiple appointments without communication</li>
                        <li>The therapeutic relationship is no longer beneficial</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>In the event of termination, you are responsible for any outstanding balances, and we will provide referrals to other providers when appropriate.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Record Keeping and Retention</h4>
                    <p>We maintain clinical records in accordance with Connecticut state law and professional ethical guidelines. Records are kept for a minimum of seven years from the last date of service (or longer if required by law). After the retention period, records are destroyed in a secure manner.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Website & Technology Use</h4>
                    <p>Our website and patient portal use industry-standard security measures to protect your information. However, no electronic communication is completely secure. By using our digital services, you acknowledge and accept these inherent risks.</p>
                    
                    <p>When using telehealth services, you are responsible for ensuring you have a stable internet connection and are in a private, confidential location.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Agreement to Terms</h4>
                    <p class="policy-note">These terms are effective as of your first appointment and remain in effect throughout our therapeutic relationship. By attending your first session, you acknowledge that you have received, read, and agree to these terms of service.</p>
