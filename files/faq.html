                        <p>Getting started is simple. Contact us by phone, email, or through our contact form to schedule an initial consultation. During this first session, we'll discuss your concerns, goals, and determine if we're a good fit for your therapeutic needs. We'll also go over practical details like scheduling, fees, and what to expect from therapy.</p>

                        <p>We accept most major insurance plans. Please contact our office to verify your specific coverage. We can also provide superbills for out-of-network reimbursement if your plan allows. For self-pay clients, we offer competitive rates and have limited sliding scale spots available for those experiencing financial hardship.</p>

                        <p>Your first session is an opportunity for us to get to know each other. We'll discuss your background, current challenges, what brings you to therapy, and what you hope to achieve. This is also your chance to ask questions and determine if our approach feels right for you. The initial session is collaborative and designed to help us create a personalized treatment plan together.</p>

                        <p>Yes, we offer secure, HIPAA-compliant telehealth sessions for your convenience. Many clients find virtual sessions just as effective as in-person appointments, with the added benefit of flexibility and comfort. You can attend therapy from your home, office, or any private location with a stable internet connection.</p>

                        <p>Standard therapy sessions are 50 minutes. Initially, weekly sessions are recommended to build momentum in your treatment and establish a strong therapeutic relationship. As you progress, we may adjust the frequency based on your needs and goals. Some clients transition to biweekly or monthly sessions over time.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, confidentiality is a cornerstone of therapy and protected by law and professional ethics. There are rare exceptions, such as if there is imminent danger to yourself or others, suspected child or elder abuse, or if required by a court order. We'll discuss confidentiality in detail during your first session so you understand your rights and the limits of privacy.</p>

                        <p>The length of therapy varies greatly depending on your individual needs, goals, and circumstances. Some people benefit from short-term therapy (8-12 sessions) focused on specific issues, while others engage in longer-term therapy to address more complex concerns or achieve deeper personal growth. We'll regularly review your progress together and adjust the treatment plan as needed.</p>

                        <p>We require at least 24 hours notice for cancellations or rescheduling. This allows us to offer your time slot to another client in need. Late cancellations (less than 24 hours notice) or no-shows may be subject to a fee equal to the full session rate, which cannot be billed to insurance. We understand that emergencies happen and will work with you on a case-by-case basis.</p>

However, therapy is most effective when substantive work happens during scheduled sessions. In case of a mental health emergency, please call 911, go to your nearest emergency room, or call the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.</p>

If you feel therapy isn't helping, please let us know so we can discuss your concerns and adjust our approach. Sometimes progress is subtle, and other times we may need to try different techniques. If we determine that a different type of therapy or provider would better serve your needs, we'll help you find appropriate referrals.</p>
