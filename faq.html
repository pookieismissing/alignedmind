                        <p>Getting started is simple. Contact us by phone, email, or through our contact form to schedule an initial consultation. During this first session, we'll discuss your concerns, goals, and determine if we're a good fit for your therapeutic needs. We'll also go over practical details like scheduling, fees, and what to expect from therapy.</p>

                        <p>Standard therapy sessions are 50 minutes. Initially, weekly sessions are recommended to build momentum in your treatment and establish a strong therapeutic relationship. As you progress, we may adjust the frequency based on your needs and goals. Some clients transition to biweekly or monthly sessions over time.</p>

                        <p>Yes, confidentiality is a cornerstone of therapy and protected by law and professional ethics. There are rare exceptions, such as if there is imminent danger to yourself or others, suspected child or elder abuse, or if required by a court order. We'll discuss confidentiality in detail during your first session so you understand your rights and the limits of privacy.</p>

                        <p>The length of therapy varies greatly depending on your individual needs, goals, and circumstances. Some people benefit from short-term therapy (8-12 sessions) focused on specific issues, while others engage in longer-term therapy to address more complex concerns or achieve deeper personal growth. We'll regularly review your progress together and adjust the treatment plan as needed.</p>

However, therapy is most effective when substantive work happens during scheduled sessions. In case of a mental health emergency, please call 911, go to your nearest emergency room, or call the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.</p>

If you feel therapy isn't helping, please let us know so we can discuss your concerns and adjust our approach. Sometimes progress is subtle, and other times we may need to try different techniques. If we determine that a different type of therapy or provider would better serve your needs, we'll help you find appropriate referrals.</p>
