## 🔧 Pages That Need Manual Content Review

### FAQ Page (faq.html)

- Insurance question needs update: practice is self-pay only
- Add FAQ about controlled substances policy (you don't prescribe them)
- Add FAQ about scope of practice (outpatient only, not for high-acuity)

### Contact Page (contact.html)
- **Mostly correct** but review form submission
- Consider adding note: "not an emergency service"

### Practice Info Page (practice-info.html)
- **This needs the MOST updates** - replace ALL content with your actual policies from PDF
- Should include:
  - Your exact attendance/cancellation policy
  - No controlled substances policy
  - In-person only policy
  - Scope of practice/acuity policy
  - ESA letter policy
  - All policies from your PDF

## 📝 Specific Content to Add/Update

### From Your Policies PDF:

1. **No Controlled Substances**: Add prominent note that you don't prescribe stimulants, benzodiazepines, opioids, etc.

3. **Fees Policy**:
   - New patient: $200
   - Follow-up: $100
   - No-show fee: $75
   - Form completion fee: $40 (outside appointments)

## 🎯 Quick Action Items

1. **Update practice-info.html** with complete policies from your PDF

3. **Add About Ann** - her credentials, background as psychiatric NP
4. **Test all links** - make sure no .html extensions remain
5. **Add patient portal URL** when you have it
